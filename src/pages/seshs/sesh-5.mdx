Last session there was a woman that was fallowing us but seems to have stopped.
Here we stay at a hotel for the night. The next day we get a taxi to the bottom
 of the mountain. Once we get to the top of the mountain we see the ship surrounded 
 by water. I use Kevin to get a better look. We find a droid and a skinny 
 wolf/fox like creature next to it.

 Droid The droid opens the ship for us and I use Kevin to go head. I roll a snake eyes and 
 I fly Kevin into a bulkhead. We find blood on the ground and as the droid recharges, tells
 us what happened on the ship.

Some of the crew were part of some sort of shady pharmaceutical company. They were experimenting
on Marigold but before she completely lost her thoughts, she fought back, got comms out for 
help, and put herself in cryo to prevent the drugs from killing her.
