**Backstory:**

Cousin is named Beatrice Hutchinson:
She was addicted to "something" for years, and we were unable to get her the help she needed. 
She was subsequently aided by Markev Mithy, and she has remained sober for years.

Her "boyfriend" is Carl Upton (married to Jaqueline Upton (nee Roduigez))
He is the CEO of a small(ish) pharmaceutical company. 

Her cousin Beatrice, now works for the pharmacy that Carl is the head of. She had heard of a threat to 
Carl's career was coming from some underworld person, and she warned Jennifer that he may be in danger from 
there. She still needs to find a connection to go with the group to investigate this... but it gives Jennifer 
something to go on.
