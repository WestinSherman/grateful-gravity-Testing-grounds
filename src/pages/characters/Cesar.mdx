Background/Career:
Took four years at university, during which he met Kaz and the General.
Had four years as a scholar/scientist, met Markev during (the siege of Outpost Delta), progressed to Rank 1, and came across the Catalyst Device. This led to making an enemy of Dr. Adrian Vayl and probably prevented Cesar from advancing any further.
He still did four more years and received advanced training.

On **Flammarian**
Prof. Smith tells me: Marigold (ally) was in a ship – lost track of it – haven’t heard from in a long time – weeks. Was last heard of on their way to **Walston** (3 weeks away). 
Prof. Smith says he doesn’t agree with the investors, but he probably does.
Investors want their ship back
If we find Marigold, you’ll be paid (will get the ship and do repairs, if needed)
Will probably need a crew – at least 2 – up to four
Will give you codes ASAP
Standard class tickets to Walston
